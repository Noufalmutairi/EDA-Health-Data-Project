# Health Data Project | EDA using Python

## Overview
The Health Data Project explores and analyzes synthetic health data. The dataset contains information about patients, including their age, gender, medical conditions, test results, medications, insurance providers, admission types, admission dates, discharge dates,billing amounts and Length of stay.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Ha_dataset.csv`) contains 770 rows and 12 columns.
Note: this dataset is synthetic , just for practising Analysis skills.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
- Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables like age, gender, medical conditions, etc.
- Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables.
- Multivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships involving multiple variables simultaneously.

## Technologies Used
- Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
