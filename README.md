# Health Data Project | EDA using Python

## Overview
The Health Data Project explores and analyzes synthetic health data. The dataset contains information about patients, including their age, gender, medical conditions, test results, medications, insurance providers, admission types, admission dates, discharge dates,billing amounts and Length of stay.

## Dataset
The dataset (`Ha_dataset.csv`) contains 770 rows and 12 columns.

### Data Dictionary:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
- **Medical Condition**: Medical condition(s) diagnosed for the patient.
- **Test Result**: Result of the diagnostic test performed for the patient.
- **Medication**: Medication prescribed to the patient.
- **Insurance Provider**: Insurance provider for the patient.
- **Amount Billing**: Billing amount for the patient's healthcare services.
- **Admission Type**: Type of admission for the patient (Emergency/Elective/Urgent).
- **Admission Date**: Date of admission for the patient.
- **Discharge Date**: Date of discharge for the patient.
- **Length of Stay**: Length of stay in days for the patient.

## Analysis
The Health Data Project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. It covers various aspects such as data cleaning, univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
- Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables like age, gender, medical conditions, etc.
- Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables.
- Multivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships involving multiple variables simultaneously.

## Technologies Used
